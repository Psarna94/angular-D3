# angular-d3

A project I recently understood to better understand D3.JS, a library for building dynamic graphs

It shows the UFO sightings in the year 2008 over the period of 12 months.


This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.12.1.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
